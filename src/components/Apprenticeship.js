                            CyberDyne VESPA+ ACE VESPA runs an academic support network and community for all six majors here at the College of Engineering & Computer Science and for MIS Majors at the College of Business. As most of the original admin team have graduated, it’s time for the next Generation to step forward and run VESPA starting from September 2021 till ideally 2024. Part of this apprenticeship is like your usual internship, dealing with projects, etc. However, the other part is unique; as part of the apprenticeship will test your abilities of diligence, persistence, and adaptability in the form of challenges. We are searching for 40~55 students to step forward and help keep CyberDyne VESPA’s server network running, by working in teams. Lastly, both apprenticeships will allow you to network with Faculty in both the ECS and MIS Programs; which by communicating with both students and faculty, you will have a great opportunity to get or improve your soft skills!
